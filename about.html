<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Ottawa Brahms Choir was founded as the &quot;Johannes Brahms Choir&quot; in late 1980 by musical director Mr. Dieter Kiesewalter.</p>
<p>Over the years since then, the choir's repertoire has consisted primarily of German-language choral works from the renaissance to the modern periods, including many by Hassler, Schuetz, Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Brahms and Mendelssohn.</p>
<p>The choir has usually performed two major concerts a year and has been joined in concert performances by guest choirs from both the Ottawa area and abroad and smaller vocal and instrumental groups and soloists.</p>
<p>In April 2005, the year of the choir's 25th anniversary, the choir performed the first of a series of three concerts with the following groups: Carleton University's Early Music Ensemble, the Croatian Folk Ensemble and the Alpentrio. Highlights of the program were Telemann's Schulmeister Kantate, with the choir's conductor, Iain Phillips, as soloist, and a premiere performance of two songs written and composed especially in recognition of the choir's 25th anniversary by Ottawa composer and musician Helmut Seemann.</p>
<p>After the untimely death of Iain Phillips, Jiri Hlavacek became the new director. Under his direction the choir performed Ryba's Czech Christmas Mass in December 2006.</p>
<p>Over the years the Ottawa Brahms Choir has evolved into a community choir with a classical and contemporary repertoire, singing in German, English and French.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2011 the closing event of their 30th anniversary featured the Brahms German Requiem, Opus 40, directed by Kurt Ala-Kantti.</p>
<p>The 2011-2012 season was closed with a sold out performance of Orff's Carmina Burana.</p>
<p>From 2012 to 2014 the choir was directed by Denise Hawkins and accompanied by Ioulia Blinova, with Jenna Richards, and continued to offer audiences a wide range of choral music, from classical to contemporary, while maintaining its roots in the German repertoire.</p>
In July 2014 Christopher Askwith was appointed new director. In 2015, the choir entered its 35th season, and Svetlana Logigan became our new accompanist.

<h2 id="musical-director">Musical Director</h2>
<p>Christopher Askwith graduated from Carleton University in 2006, having studied classical voice with Susan Blyth-Schofield and taken classes in composition (and, subsequently, conducting). He has been active in Ottawa's choral scene for nearly twenty years, as a member of the Ottawa Regional Youth Choir, Carleton University Choir, Ottawa Choral Society, and Ottawa Bach Choir.</p>
Christopher is a founding member of the Harmonia Choir of Ottawa, and remains with that choir, not only as a chorister, but also in the capacity of Composer-in-Residence. He has conducted choral workshops for youth and briefly conducted a small local choir, the Vista Singers, and looks forward to the opportunity and challenge of working with the Ottawa Brahms Choir.

<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
<p>To serve Ottawa's multicultural musical tradition, and to offer an authentic voice for original German language choral works, with some emphasis on Brahms and the classical and romantic repertoire.</p>
<h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>
The Ottawa Brahms Choir aims to inspire the musical growth of choristers; to focus on sacred and art music from the Renaissance to the present day, especially in the Romantic-era German-language tradition and to bring our love of music to the community through biannual concerts.
